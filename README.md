# Roman Numerals
Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage.  

Build a class translator that takes some text, finds the numbers and converts them, and then return the whole text with the numbers changed.  

Break this class into 2 so that one class finds numbers, and passes them to another class that can convert the numbers.
