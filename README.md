# Roman Numerals
The aim of this challenge was to break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage.  

First build a class that takes some text, finds the numbers and converts them, and then return the whole text with the numbers changed to Roman numerals.  

Break this class into 2 so that one class finds numbers within a string, and passes them to another class that can convert the numbers to Roman numerals.
